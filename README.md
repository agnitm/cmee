# Conductance Model for Extreme Events (CMEE)
The Conductance Model for Extreme Events is a model under construction to replace the present empirical conductance model in the Space Weather Modeling Framework. This model is based on AMIE data from the year of 2003, which contain extreme space weather events, so as to include extreme maximas in the estimation of conductance and provide improved ground based predictions. 

- Contains all the Python code and variable files used to create the final set of coefficients.
- Publicly available.
